This directory contains two copies of the Learning Java source code packaged for eclipse.  The difference is that the "Appendix A" version contains inner "Learning Java" folder and the "Chapter 2" version has the contents at the top level of the zip file.  We apologize for the necessity of the two versions; the loading instructions in each chapter are slightly different and will be reconciled in inner future update.
